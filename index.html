        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
            Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic. (OOP) is a valuable tool when it comes to thinking about large programming projects because it takes the view that what we really care about are the objects we want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. The concept of a data class makes it possible to define subclasses of the data objects that share some or all of the main class characteristics. Thus, it allows the programmer to use such things like, inheritance, which makes coding a lot easier.

          <p>
            In (OOP) the objects are the things you think about first in designing a program and they are also the units of code that are eventually derived from the process. Each object is an instance of a particular class or subclass with the class's own methods or procedures and data variables. An object is what actually runs in the computer.

        <p>
         A class is a template definition of the methods and variables in a particular kind of object. The class is one of the defining ideas of object-oriented programming. A class can have subclasses that can inherit all or some of the characteristics of the class. A class is similar to a blueprint. A class can have both data and methods.

  <div class="concept-title">Instance</div>
  <div class="concept-description">
    <p>
      An instance in (OOP) is a specific realization of any object. An object may be varied in a number of ways. Each realized variation of that object is an instance. The creation of a realized instance is called instantiation. Each time a program runs, it is an instance of that program. In languages that create objects from classes, an object is an instantiation of a class. So in simpler terms, an instance is basically  a sub-group within a class.

    <div class="concept-title">Method</div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
        A method is a programmed procedure in object oriented programming that is defined as part of a class and included in any object of that class.A method in an object can only have access to the data known to that object, which ensures data integrity among the sets of objects in an application. It is also important to note that a method can be re-used in multiple objects. All of the functions inside a class are associated with an instance and have the first argument as self.

    <div class="concept-title">Module</div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
        A module is a component of a larger system that interacts with the rest of the system in a simple, well-defined, straight foward manner. The idea is that a module can be "plugged into" a system. The details of what goes inside the module are not important to the system as a whole, as long as the module fulfills it assigned role correctly.

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
         In (OOP), a class library is a collection of prewritten classes or coded templates, any of which can be specified and used by a programmer when developing an application program. The programmer specifies which classes are being used and furnishes data that instantiates each class an an object that can be called when the program is executed. Access to and use of a class library greatly simplifies the job of the programmer since standard, pretested code is available that the programmer doesn't have to write.

          <p>
            Inheritance and Method overriding concepts can be applied to HTML/CSS although to a different degree. Inheritance and Method overriding and two fundamentel concepts in CSS. Inheritance is associated with how the elements in the HTML markup inherit properties from their parent elements and pass them on to their children. While the method overriding has to do with the CSS declarations being applied to a document, and  how conflicting rules do or don't override each other. However, not all CSS properties are inherited m because it doesnt make sense for some of them to be. In HTML every element in an HTML document will inherit all inheritable properties from its parent except the root element, which of course does not have a parent. Inheritance lets us delcare properties on high-level elements and allows those properties to trickle down to all descendant elements. Only some properties are inherited by default, but inheritance can be forced with the (inherit) keyword. The method overriding concept sorts out all conflicts when multiple declarations would affect a given element. Important declarations will override less important ones. Among declarations with equal imporatance, the rule's specificity controls which one will apply.
